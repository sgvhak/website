Meetings
========

Meetings generally occur on the the first Thursday of the month between 6:30 PM
and 9 PM and the fourth Saturday of the month from 2 PM to 6 PM. Meetings are
scheduled through the `SGVTech Meetup Group
<https://www.meetup.com/SGVTech/>`_. Check there for up to date information.

These are hands-on working meetings. There are tables, free wifi, and a group
of knowledgeable people. So come, bring your projects, show off your new toys,
and just connect with your fellow hardware geeks. There is even a projector if
you want to do a mini-presentation.

In addition, Dave welcomes anyone to come by his shop on Mondays around 6PM to
work on projects or chat informally.
