| Arcadia, CA 91006

It is off Peck Road between Lower Azusa and Live Oak.  It is two lights south of
Live Oak.

These are hands-on working meetings. There are tables, free wifi, and a group of knowledgeable people. So come, bring your projects, show off your new toys, and just connect with your fellow hardware geeks. There is even a projector if you want to do a mini-presentation.

As you know, we were not able to reserve our usual timeslot at Hastings Branch Library.  Instead, we reserved the 4th Saturday afternoon from 2-6pm.

Our first Saturday meeting will be July 27th.  I understand that some of our regulars won't be able to make it.  I'm hoping that this new timeslot is more convenient for other folks.  It's a nice long time to work on stuff, or maybe conduct a workshop.    I'll send out another reminder next week.


When: Saturday, 07/27/2013 2:00 - 6:00 PM
Where: Hastings Branch Library (3325 East Orange Grove Boulevard Pasadena, CA 91107)
Come find us at the meeting room near the circulation desk.
