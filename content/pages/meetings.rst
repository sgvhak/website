Meetings
========

Meetings generally occur on the the first and third Thursdays of the month, between 6:30pm and 9pm as well as the fourth Saturday of the month from 2pm to 6pm. Meetings are scheduled through the `SGVTech Meetup Group <https://www.meetup.com/SGVTech/>`_. Check there for up to date information.

These are hands-on working meetings. There are tables, free wifi, and a group of knowledgeable people. So come, bring your projects, show off your new toys, and just connect with your fellow hardware geeks. There is even a projector if you want to do a mini-presentation.
