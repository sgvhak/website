Do you like working on hardware projects? Did you get a Raspberry Pi/Arduino/Kinect with the intentions of doing something cool? Do you wish that there was a local group where you can meet up with like-minded folks and actually make progress with your projects?

Our group serves to connect fellow software and hardware geeks in the Los Angles Basin and specifically the San Gabriel Valley. Our members meet to share some of the projects they've been working on and get ideas for new ones. Our intention is to spur collaboration and enthusiasm.
